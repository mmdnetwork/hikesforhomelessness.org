<h4>Shoe Drive</h4>
We are currently conducting a shoe drive.  If you have any new or gently used shoes you would like to give to someone in need don't hesitate to get in contact with us!  We can definitely get them to the people who need them the most.

You may deliver the shoes to the address below:
<h5>8491 Heritage Hill Dr.</h5>
<h5>Elk Grove CA, 95624</h5>
&nbsp;

Or you may call and have the shoes picked up:
<h5>+1 (916) 895 - 2359</h5>
&nbsp;

You may also make a cash donation:
<h5>The suggested donation amount is $20.00</h5>
